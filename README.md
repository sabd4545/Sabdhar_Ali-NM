Emotion Detection through Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Conversations
Project Overview
This project aims to detect and classify emotions from social media text using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Emotions such as joy, anger, sadness, fear, and surprise are identified to provide actionable insights for businesses, researchers, and mental health analysts.

Problem Type
Multiclass classification using supervised machine learning.

Objectives
Preprocess and clean social media text data.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Engineer features from text for improved prediction.
Train and compare multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM, and BERT.
Maximize model performance (accuracy, F1-score).
Visualize results and key influencing features.
Tools & Technologies
Python
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, nltk, TensorFlow (for LSTM), transformers (for BERT)
Dataset
The dataset used contains text samples and associated emotion labels. See dataset.csv for the complete dataset.
